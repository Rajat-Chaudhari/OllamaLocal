       "\"The displacement current, a term coined by Maxwell in his treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873), is a quantity that was added to the Ampere's law for magnetostatics. This was necessary because the original Ampere's law, in its differential form, predicted infinite values of the magnetic field when the electric field at which it depended vanished. The displacement current concept fills this gap by replacing the zero divergence of the original E-field with a non-zero value and thus saves Ampere's law from inconsistencies.\\n\\nThe displacement current is present in every capacitor and dielectric material where there are variations in the applied voltage, even if no direct conduction occurs. It represents the fact that any electric field will induce an electrically oscillating magnetic field which is proportional to the rate of change of this electric field. The direction of the magnetic field lines in a conductor or capacitor, for instance, is perpendicular to both the displacement current and the original E-field.\\n\\nThe displacement current density D can be defined as:\\n\\nJd = ε0*dE/dt\\n\\nWhere dE/dt represents the time rate of change of E-fields\""
